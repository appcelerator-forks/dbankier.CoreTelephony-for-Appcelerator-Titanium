CoreTelephony Module for Titanium
=================================

This module exposes SOME of the iOS CoreTelephony Framework. It retreives the current
call states and call-ids (not CLID). It was developed because I needed a way of returning
to the app after a call that was initiated from the app ended. See the example for how 
to do it.

Note that this only works with iOS SDK 4.x and above. You can do something like this to conditionally use the module:
if	(Titanium.Platform.name == 'iPhone OS' && parseInt(Titanium.Platform.version.split(".")[0], 10) >=4) {
    // Use code
}


Quick Start
-----------
1. Download: com.yydigital.coretelephony-iphone-0.1.zip
2. Unzip it to the titanium directory. (In iOS it is /Library/Application\ Support/Titanium/)
3. Modify the tiapp.xml file to include the module, for example:
    <modules>
        <module version="0.1">com.yydigital.coretelephony</module>
    </modules>


Code snippets
-------------

To import the module:
  var core = require('com.yydigital.coretelephony');

To get the current calls:
  var calls = core.getCurrentCalls();

Check if there are active calls:
  var are_there_active_calls = (calls != null);

This can be used to get the number of active calls:
  var active_calls_number = calls.length;

You can get the call state (diailing, incomming, connected and disconnected) of a call as follows:
  calls[0].callState;

And callid (which is not CLID so pretty useless):
  calls[0].callID;


Compiled Module
---------------
Just download com.yydigital.coretelephony-iphone-0.1.zip of you are not interested in the source.


Contributions
-------------
I'm happy for this module to grow/improve. Just send me a message.
