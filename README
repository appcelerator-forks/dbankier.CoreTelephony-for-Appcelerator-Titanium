CoreTelephony Module for Titanium
=================================

This module exposes SOME of the iOS CoreTelephony Framework. It retreives the current
call states and call-ids (not CLID). It was developed because I needed a way of returning
to the app after a call that was initiated from the app ended. See the example for how 
to do it.

Code snippets
-------------

To import the module:
  var core = require('com.yydigital.coretelephony');

To get the current calls:
  var calls = core.getCurrentCalls();

This can be used to get the number of active calls:
  var active_calls_number = calls.length;

You can get the call state (diailing, incomming, connected and disconnected) of a call as follows:
  calls[0].callState;

And callid (which is not CLID so pretty useless):
  calls[0].callID;


Compiled Module
---------------
Just download coretelephony.tar.gz of you are not interested in the code.

I'm happy for this module to grow/improve. Just send me a message.
